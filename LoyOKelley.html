            <p>Loy O'Kelley is a real person, but more importantly, he is a combination of attibutes attained through being in the military for all of 
                his teen to adult existence (school or active duty).  
                Some people love him, others hate him, but he just is.  Whether he stays a hero or becomes a villian now in the real world is yet to be known.</p>
